# About me
:stylesheet: ../stylesheet.css

General geek, passionate about technology, networking and security.

Always had an interest in radio communications. Grew up with walkie-talkies and short wave radios, had a CB radio in my car as soon as I had my driving license, more for listening than actually transmitting.

Built my first (c)antennas during the craze of community wireless with flashed wrt54g.

RTL-SDRs then reintroduced me progressively to radio world.

Licenced march 2020, just before covid lockdown #1.

I like tinkering more than making QSOs, contributing to opensource ham software, building various antennas…


## QTH

Saint Aubin du Cormier in Brittany, France. Gridsquare IN98hg, 50km south-east of Mont-Saint-Michel.

Founded 800 years ago, Saint Aubin du Cormier was home of a famous battle between French and Bretons, whose defeat precipitated the end of the independence of Brittany from France.
